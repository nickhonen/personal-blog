# Yo
Sorry y’all its been a while, I may not have been blogging but I have kept up the journey luckily. Gonna take a lot more than React to sink this ship! It’s officially been 35 days since I decided against taking a bootcamp, and almost two months since I decided to not go back to college. Life’s been good, I’ve been happier than I ever was while in school, and I’m learning infinitely more as well. However, one thing has been eating away at my conscious. 

I’m just gonna cut right to the chase. I know a bit about web dev now, much more than when I started. But it’s time for me to actually start making stuff. For whatever reason, I’m not sure if it’s anxiety related, laziness, or just plain incompetence, but I have been subtly putting off making personal projects ever since I started. I always tell myself I’m not ready yet, or I should be focusing on something else instead, even though I KNOW it’s what everyone needs to do to truly improve. It most likely stems from a combination of all the things I’ve mentioned, as well as a general fear of failure. Because I know making projects is the way to success, it could just as easily be the start of my failure to make it as a programmer as well. 

### Idk about y’all but I’m tired of making these lame excuses to myself all the time. It ends now.  

When you hear from me next, I will have made something. It will likely (definitely) suck, and it probably won’t be original or technically impressive. But it will be **MY** thing. And it will be complete, with a functioning UI, and a live instance hosted somewhere. 

I’d love to stay and write more, but I gotta get to work. This to-do list or whatever I decide to do ain’t gonna make itself. Will update y’all in a few days hopefully with a completed project. In the meantime, I’ll be blasting synth wave and staying glued to my faux ergonomic chair.
