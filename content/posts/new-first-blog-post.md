## First post!

I started a blog, finally. Been putting this off for as long as I've been programming, for whatever reason. The task of making one from scratch seemed daunting, I didn't know where to start, would anyone even care, would people judge me, were a few of the reasons that held me back for a while. However, life is too damn short to spend time worrying about starting a blog, when I can just sit down and write!

Gonna mess about with markdown for the rest of this test post as I've never used it before! Just want to see if I have a handle on everything.


### I wonder what code highlighting looks like here

```javascript
let u = "myblog";
alert(u);
```
Apparently three or more hyphens makes a horizontal rule, let's see if it looks any good

Eh? How is it?
