<br>
I'm an aspiring software engineer, currently finishing up my Computer Science degree (done in August). My broad technical focus is backend/fullstack development, but I'm still in my programming honeymoon phase, meaning just about every subject interests me right now. Just excited to start my career really!<br><br>
Looking for any and all full-time job opportunities. If you're looking for a driven, passionate, and personable (no bias I promise) member of your team, email me: nickhonenwork@gmail.com.

## Now
Main project is a Discord bot that saves custom VALORANT lineups. Screwing around with some data analysis and learning Go on the side as well. Also a contributor to [Microsoft-365 CLI](https://github.com/pnp/cli-microsoft365).</br>
Going to spend significantly more time on personal projects after I finish school this summer, will update accordingly!

## Hobbies
When I'm not programming or working, I'm probably playing some type of competitive FPS, working out/running, or cooking. Hoping to run a marathon by the end of year as well, will likely blog about that whole saga too.<br><br>
Sports are also a big part of my life. I've played Soccer as long as I can remember, and it was my main focus for most of my youth/adolescence. I've also dabbled in Track (100m and 400m) and Ultimate Frisbee most significantly.
<br>I also played for my University's competitive Counter-Strike team which was quite a fun experience, even though we weren't too good.
