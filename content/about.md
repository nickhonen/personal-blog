<br>
I'm an aspiring software engineer, currently finishing up my Computer Science degree (done in August). My broad technical focus is backend/fullstack development, but I'm still in my programming honeymoon phase, meaning just about every subject interests me right now. Just excited to start my career really!<br><br>
Looking for any and all full-time job opportunities. If you're in the business for a programmer, I can at least promise to have a 10x mindset and personality (no bias).

## Now
Working on a Discord bot that saves custom VALORANT lineups. Screwing around with some data analysis and learning Go on the side as well. Also looking for jobs, so feel free to reach out

## Hobbies
When I'm not programming or working, I'm probably playing some type of competitive FPS, working out/running, or cooking. Hoping to run a marathon by the end of year as well, will likely blog about that whole saga too.
