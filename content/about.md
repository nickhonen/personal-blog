<br>
I'm an aspiring software engineer, currently finishing up my Computer Science degree (done in August). My broad technical focus is backend/fullstack development, but I'm still in my programming honeymoon phase, meaning just about every subject interests me right now. Just excited to start my career really!<br><br>
Looking for any and all full-time job opportunities. If you're looking for a very driven, passionate, and personable (no bias I promise) member of your team, email me @ nickhonenwork@gmail.com.

## Now
Working on a Discord bot that saves custom VALORANT lineups. Screwing around with some data analysis and learning Go on the side as well.

## Hobbies
When I'm not programming or working, I'm probably playing some type of competitive FPS, working out/running, or cooking. Hoping to run a marathon by the end of year as well, will likely blog about that whole saga too.<br>
Sports are also a big part of my life. I've played Soccer since I was a kid, with it being my main focus throughout my youth/teenage years. I've also dabbled in Track (400m) and Ultimate Frisbee.
